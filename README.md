# Comp 459 (Machine Learning with Graphs) Final Project

## Overview

This project explores the use of Large Language Model (LLM) embeddings as node features for improving citation link prediction on a scholarly graph. It uses embeddings generated from paper abstracts using `mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1` and feeds them into a Graph Neural Network (GNN) implemented with PyTorch Geometric. The GNN's performance is compared against traditional heuristic baselines (Common Neighbors and Adamic-Adar).

The primary code implementation and experiments are contained within the Jupyter Notebook: `comp_459_final_project.ipynb`.

The final report is contained in the file `Guan_Jang_459_Report.pdf`.
